# CollegeArduinoCode
Uploading my old C++ code used in college project.
This project used an Arduino + ESP8266 combo board.
It's function is to read and send that CO2 reading of the MQ7 to a cloud storage (used Firebase)
and that data to be read in an Android Application.

P.S - Code works but is unfinished due to Covid-19 shenanigans
