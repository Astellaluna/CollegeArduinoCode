# CollegeArduinoCode
Uploading my old C++ code used in college project.
This project used an Arduino + ESP8266 combo board.
It's function is to read and send that CO2 reading of the MQ7 to Firebase database (that was the plan)
and that data to be read in an Android Application.

Note: Code works but is unfinished due to Covid-19 shenanigans.
I also lost my APK for the unfinished android app. Forgot where I saved it
